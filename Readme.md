# Chaotunes Music Player

Chaotunes is a simple music player built using Python, `pygame`, `tkinter`, and `os` libraries. The project provides a basic GUI (Graphical User Interface) to load and play audio files in `.mp3` or `.wav` format. The music player allows users to play, pause, unpause, and stop the currently loaded audio track.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the `pygame` library using the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the `player.py` script using Python:

```bash
python player.py
```

4. The Chaotunes Music Player GUI will open.
5. Click on the "Load Music" button to browse and select an audio file (`.mp3` or `.wav`) from your computer.
6. Use the "Play", "Pause", "Unpause", and "Stop" buttons to control the playback of the loaded audio file.


## Disclaimer

This project is intended as a simple demonstration of building a music player using Python and various libraries. It may not handle all possible scenarios or edge cases. Feel free to customize and expand the code to suit your specific requirements and add more features.

Enjoy your music with Chaotunes!
